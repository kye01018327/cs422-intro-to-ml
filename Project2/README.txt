## def perceptron_train(X, Y):

1. Initialize weights and bias
    1. Initialize weights vector to have same dimension as feature vector, all initial values as 0
    2. Initialize bias as a scalar with initial value of 0
2. Until convergence (no change over one epoch), train weights and bias
    1.
